      <p>
        We work with specialty coffee from current crops which is carefully
        roasted. Our coffee is fruity, juicy and never boring. We bring you the
        best from leading european specialty roasteries, currently mostly from
        Square Mile Coffee Roasters, a multi award winning coffee roasting
        company based in East London.

            <h4>redcurrant/honeysuckle/juicy</h4>

            <p>
              Fruity redcurrant and sweet honeysuckle flavours. An incredibly
              juicy coffee which we struggled to decide on the right berry
              descriptor, but raspberry, blackberry and blueberry were also in
              the running!
